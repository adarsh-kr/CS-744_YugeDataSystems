To run this program, you would need to execute the run_code_template.sh script
You can do bash run_code_template.sh
Once you do this, an interactive menu will open up asking you for 4 options.
These represent different operating modes for the program -
1. SGD on Single Node
2. Asynchronous SGD
3. Synchronous SGD
4. TensorBoard visualization
By default all distributed SGDs run on 4 workers and 1 parameter server

To view the logs,
serverlog-[i].out, for logs on worker i
serverlog-ps-0.out, for logs on parameter server at node 0

Go to ~/tf/ to check the generated event files that can be
then viewed using TensorBoard. The command is -
tensorboard --logdir .
