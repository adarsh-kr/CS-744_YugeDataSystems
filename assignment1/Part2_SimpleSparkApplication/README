This program helps you to sort IOT data based on country code. If the country codes are same, the records would be ordered by timestamp.
The entire problem statement is at http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shivaram/cs744-fa18/assignment1.html
 
This module has been implemented in 3 ways -
1. Using Dataframes on Scala.
2. Using Dataframes on Python.
3. Using RDDs on Scala.

To run the module, please follow the below steps -
1. Extract the zip file.
2. Goto to the root of the folder and you should see a file called run.sh.
3. Verify that Spark and Hadoop have been setup and configured correctly and that the PATH has been exported.
4. Now start the script by issuing - bash run.sh
5. This will open up an interactive menu where you can enter details of the input file, output file, and which implementation you would like to use for execution.
Example -
Hello, balarjun. I am here to help you sort the data you have from an IoT dataset
Would you like to run the job using Scala or Python?Select your option (S/P) and press [ENTER]:S
Enter the name of the input file and press [ENTER]:hdfs://128.104.222.82:9000/user/balarjun/export.csv
Enter the name of the output file and press [ENTER]:hdfs://128.104.222.82:9000/user/balarjun/solution.csv
Would you like to run using RDDs or Dataframes?Select your option (R/D) and press [ENTER]:R
6. To see the consolidated sorted output on HDFS, you can run "hadoop fs -cat solution.csv/*"
